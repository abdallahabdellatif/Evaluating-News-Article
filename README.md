# Evaluating News Article
A simple page that takes a paragraph as an input and it uses an external API to analyze the text and it outputs statistics about 
the text as polarity (positive,neutral,negative..) and subjectivity
## Practices
It's mainly focused on using webpack as a build tool to make the folder *dist* which countains a bundle that saves all the files 
within it , also it uses jest as testing host to run simple test suites
## Usage
npm run build-prod and then npm start to experience the website on localhost 8082
